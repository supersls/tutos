Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is a set of specifications that define standards for building enterprise-level applications in Java. These specifications provide a framework for developing scalable, secure, and portable applications. Here are some key Java EE specifications:

1. **Servlet**: Servlet API provides a standard interface for building web applications in Java. Servlets handle HTTP requests and responses, allowing developers to create dynamic web content.
2. **JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: JSP technology enables developers to embed Java code into HTML pages, allowing for the creation of dynamic web pages. JSPs are translated into servlets by the application server.
3. **JavaServer Faces (JSF)**: JSF is a component-based framework for building web applications. It provides a rich set of UI components and a lifecycle model for managing user interactions.
4. **Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)**: EJB is a server-side component model for building distributed enterprise applications. It provides services such as transaction management, security, and persistence.
5. **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: JPA is a Java standard for object-relational mapping (ORM). It provides a set of APIs for mapping Java objects to relational database tables and performing database operations.
6. **Java Message Service (JMS)**: JMS is an API for messaging between Java applications. It provides a standard way for applications to send and receive messages asynchronously.
7. **Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)**: JAX-RS is a Java API for building RESTful web services. It provides annotations for defining resource classes and methods, making it easy to create RESTful APIs.
8. **Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS)**: JAX-WS is a Java API for building SOAP-based web services. It provides annotations and APIs for defining web service endpoints and operations.
9. **Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)**: CDI is a dependency injection framework for Java EE applications. It allows developers to define and inject dependencies using annotations.
10. **Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)**: JAAS is a Java security framework that provides authentication and authorization services for Java applications. It supports pluggable authentication modules (LoginModules) and role-based access control.

These specifications are implemented by Java EE application servers such as Apache Tomcat, WildFly, and GlassFish. Java EE provides a comprehensive platform for building enterprise applications, offering standardized APIs and services for various enterprise needs. However, it's worth noting that Java EE has been evolving, and many of its features have been incorporated into Jakarta EE, which is the successor to Java EE under the Eclipse Foundation.
