Sure, here's the explanation formatted in Markdown:

### How a Hashmap Works Internally

1. **Hashing**
   - When you insert a key-value pair into a hashmap, the hashmap computes the hash code of the key. The hash code is typically an integer value.
   - The hash code is used to determine the index or bucket where the key-value pair will be stored in the underlying array.

2. **Index Calculation**
   - The hash code is often too large to be directly used as an index, so it is mapped to a valid index within the array using a process called modulo operation.
   - The modulo operation involves taking the hash code modulo the size of the array (the number of buckets).
   - This calculated index is where the key-value pair will be stored in the array.

3. **Handling Collisions**
   - Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code or when their hash codes map to the same index.
   - To handle collisions, most hashmaps use a technique called chaining or open addressing.
     - **Chaining**: Each bucket in the array contains a linked list (or some other data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
     - **Open Addressing**: If a collision occurs, the hashmap looks for the next available slot (using probing techniques) until an empty slot is found.

4. **Insertion**
   - When inserting a new key-value pair, the hashmap first computes the hash code of the key.
   - It then calculates the index where the key-value pair will be stored.
   - If the bucket at that index is empty, the key-value pair is stored directly.
   - If the bucket is not empty due to a collision, the key-value pair is added to the existing data structure (linked list or next available slot).

5. **Retrieval**
   - To retrieve a value associated with a key, the hashmap first computes the hash code of the key.
   - It then calculates the index where the key-value pair is expected to be stored.
   - If the bucket at that index is not empty, it searches through the data structure (linked list or probing) to find the key-value pair with the matching key.
   - If the key is found, the corresponding value is returned.

6. **Removal**
   - To remove a key-value pair, the hashmap first computes the hash code of the key and calculates the index.
   - If the bucket at that index is not empty, it searches for the key-value pair to be removed.
   - If found, the pair is removed from the data structure.
   - If the bucket becomes empty after removal, it may be left empty or marked as deleted depending on the implementation.

7. **Resize**
   - As the number of key-value pairs grows, the hashmap may become too full, leading to performance degradation.
   - To avoid this, the hashmap periodically resizes its internal array (rehashing).
   - During resizing, a new, larger array is created, and all existing key-value pairs are reinserted into the new array based on their new hash codes.

This is a high-level overview of how a hashmap works internally. The actual implementation details may vary depending on the programming language and the hashmap implementation being used.
