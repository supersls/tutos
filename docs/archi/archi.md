Java application architectures can vary greatly depending on the requirements, scale, and complexity of the application. Here are some of the top Java application architectures commonly used:

1. **Layered Architecture**: This is a classic architecture where the application is divided into multiple layers such as presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Each layer has a specific responsibility and interacts only with adjacent layers.
2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: MVC separates an application into three main components: Model (business logic and data), View (presentation layer), and Controller (handles user input and interacts with the model).
3. **Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with other services through APIs.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: In an event-driven architecture, components communicate with each other by events. Events are generated by producers and consumed by one or more consumers. This architecture is well-suited for applications that need to handle a high volume of asynchronous events.
5. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Also known as Ports and Adapters, this architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of interfaces to decouple application logic from external dependencies. It consists of an inner core (domain logic) surrounded by layers of adapters (input/output interfaces).
6. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: DDD focuses on modeling a software system based on the domain it operates in. It emphasizes creating a rich domain model and defining ubiquitous language shared by developers and domain experts.
7. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: SOA is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service implements a specific business function and can be accessed using standard protocols such as HTTP or SOAP.
8. **Serverless Architecture**: Serverless architecture abstracts the infrastructure management from developers, allowing them to focus on writing code. Applications are built as a collection of stateless functions that are triggered by events.
9. **Component-Based Architecture**: In this architecture, an application is built by assembling pre-built software components. Components encapsulate specific functionality and can be reused across different applications.
10. **Clean Architecture**: Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency inversion. It consists of concentric layers with the inner layers containing business logic and the outer layers containing frameworks and delivery mechanisms.

These are just a few examples of Java application architectures, and often architectures are combined or customized based on the specific requirements of the application.
