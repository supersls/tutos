It seems like you're referring to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), not "cass". Below, I'll cover the basics of both CSS and SASS:

### CSS Basics:

**1. Selectors:** Selectors are used to target HTML elements. Here are some common selectors:

- Element Selector: `p { ... }`
- Class Selector: `.my-class { ... }`
- ID Selector: `#my-id { ... }`
- Attribute Selector: `[type="text"] { ... }`
- Descendant Selector: `div p { ... }`

**2. Properties and Values:** CSS properties define the styles of an element, and each property has a value. For example:

```css
   .my-class {
       color: blue;
       font-size: 16px;
   }
```

**3. Box Model:** Every element in CSS is considered a rectangular box, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.

- Content: The actual content of the box.
- Padding: Space between the content and the border.
- Border: A line that surrounds the padding.
- Margin: Space outside the border, separating it from other elements.

**4. Cascade and Specificity:** CSS follows a cascading order, meaning styles can cascade down from parent elements to child elements. Specificity determines which style rule takes precedence if multiple rules conflict.

### SASS Basics:

**1. Variables:** SASS allows you to define variables to store reusable values.

```scss
   $primary-color: #336699;
```

**2. Nesting:** You can nest selectors within one another to represent a nested structure in your HTML.

```scss
   .container {
       background-color: #fff;
       .header {
           font-size: 24px;
       }
       .content {
           padding: 20px;
       }
   }
```

**3. Mixins:** Mixins allow you to define reusable styles that can be included in other selectors.

```scss
   @mixin flex-center {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: center;
       align-items: center;
   }

   .container {
       @include flex-center;
   }
```

**4. Partials and Imports:** You can split your SASS code into separate files and then import them into a main SASS file using the `@import` directive.

**5. Inheritance:** SASS supports inheritance through the `@extend` directive, allowing one selector to inherit styles from another.

**6. Operators and Functions:** SASS provides various built-in functions and operators for performing operations on values.

To use SASS, you need to compile it into regular CSS, which can be done using command-line tools, build systems like Webpack, or online compilers.

These are just the basics of CSS and SASS. Both CSS and SASS offer many more features and capabilities for styling web pages.
